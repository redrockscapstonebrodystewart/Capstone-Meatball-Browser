# Capstone-Meatball-Browser
Red Rocks Community College 2023 Capstone project. Basic Web Browser.
By Brody Stewart

## Installation
Press the code dropdown menu and select download zip.
Extract the folder and just run the MeatballBrowser.exe!

If the meatball browser executable doesn't work, you may need to directly download the exe file by going to dist/meatballbrowser then "View Raw" which will download it. Then just plop that baby right into the extracted folder from earlier.

The exe may be considered a virus by virus protection programs, as it did with mine.
This is quite literally just a direct py file that was made into an exe with pyinstaller and is a known false alarm regarding pyinstaller executables.
However, if you don't want to risk it - I don't blame you, I wouldn't trust it either. Therefore, I've included the actual pycharm project files under /ProjectFiles. You can either just run it from pycharm or another IDE, or compile it yourself.
